# Inspie Me Alarm Clock (Android App)
### Be inspired every morning (and awake)!



Android alarm clock application which will present the user with an inspirational quote which the user has to read out loud to turn off the alarm!

<div style="overflow: auto;">

  <img src="graphics/sc_create_alarm.jpg" width="175" style="float:left">
  <img src="graphics/sc_alarm.jpg" width="175" style="float:left">
</div>

<!--

The most interesting part of the project is setting the broadcast receiver to capture the alarm. Therefore, even if the user close the alarm activity, still it will schedule another activity to check if the alarm is turned off using the challenge.
